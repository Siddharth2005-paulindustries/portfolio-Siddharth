            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Greetings! I’m Siddharth, a Computer Science enthusiast deeply invested in unraveling the complex web of technology and security that defines our digital age. My journey through the vast and intricate world of computing has been shaped by a relentless curiosity and an unyielding drive to explore the intersection of cryptography, cybersecurity, and the theoretical underpinnings of quantum science. From the dynamic algorithms powering modern-day encryption to the elegant architectures of secure systems, I am captivated by the craft of creating, protecting, and advancing our shared digital future.</p>
            
            <p>My academic pursuits go beyond the conventional curriculum, as I am constantly drawn to the rigor of subjects that test both intellect and ingenuity. I am preparing to specialize in the advanced realms of cryptographic theory, secure communication networks, and the mathematical foundations of computer science. The elegance and precision in these areas offer a unique thrill, while the challenges they present fuel my ambition to become a thought leader in this space.</p>
            
            <p>Alongside my technical passions, I’m someone who finds inspiration in the stories and events that have shaped our past. I have a strong appreciation for history, geopolitics, and the nuanced dance of global politics. These interests enrich my understanding of the world, giving me a broader perspective on how technology interacts with society and the ethical responsibilities that come with it. The narratives of past innovators and world events remind me that every breakthrough, whether in science or society, began with a single idea and a drive to see it through.</p>
            
            <p>Beyond the world of code and logic, I find grounding in my personal beliefs and inspirations. As a Shakta Hindu, I draw strength from spiritual principles that balance my ambition, guiding me to approach each challenge with resilience and integrity. In my downtime, I’m drawn to the mystique of wolves and tigers—symbols of strength, independence, and loyalty—and the color black, with its depth and elegance, resonates with the kind of grounded determination I strive for.</p>
            
            <p>I invite you to explore my work, connect over shared interests, or simply engage in a conversation. Whether through technology or thoughtful discussion, I believe in pushing boundaries and exploring new perspectives in a world that’s constantly evolving.</p>
